\item Group Members\+: Morgan Young, Amber Hankins, and Mohagoney Moore.
\item Morgan and Amber contributed by developing the code for the Processor, Noise Gate, Normalizer, Echo, Wave Header, and user interaction. Mohagoney\textquotesingle{}s contributions were in creating the Doxygen documentations and writing up the report and information needed, with minor contributions to the metadata to C\+SV conversion in the user interface.

\item One of the major challenges faced within this project was getting the metadata from the .wav files and printing them into a C\+SV if the user chose to do so. The primary issue would come down to the fundamental understanding of the metadata and file I/O.
